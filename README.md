## 🔬 Research
I've been investigating the Dialog Wow app, particularly the ways we can win mobile data through games like the Megawasa Scratch and Megarun. It got me thinking—why not automate this? So, I started looking into ways to make it happen.

## 🛠️ Technical Challenges
At first, I thought it would be easy. But then, surprise! It wasn't just a game like the old megarun. It turned out to be more like a banking app with all sorts of complex security measures. Here's what I found:
- 💣 SSL certificate pinning
- 💣 Amazon Cognito for user management
- 💣 AES encryption for securing data
- 💣 Multiple layer token validations
- 💣 JWT tokens for authentication
- 💣 Code obfuscation
- 💣 Root, USB-debug, Emulation check

## 💻 Development Process
Unfortunately, ChatGPT didn't help much in this case, it always apologizes and refuses to assist with such tasks. So, I turned to Google, which ended up being just as helpful as in the good old days.

After some sleepless and messy days, I finally managed to crack it. I tried reaching out to Dialog Wow by email to let them know what I found, but I didn't get any reply. Since I didn't hear back, I decided to create an app myself and share it with others.

## 📝 Disclaimer
Hey Dialog, if you see this, I don't want any trouble. Just reply to me, and I'll take it down. I can even remotely disable it on installed devices.
